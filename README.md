# ðŸ”¢ Parallel Matrix Multiplication

A high-performance implementation of matrix multiplication using **Strassenâ€™s algorithm** and **OpenMP-based parallelization**. Developed as part of a Parallel Computing course to explore recursive algorithms and multithreading performance gains.

---

## ðŸš€ Objective

Optimize matrix multiplication for large-scale square matrices by reducing computational complexity and leveraging parallel threads for improved runtime performance.

---

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

- Implemented a recursive version of **Strassenâ€™s matrix multiplication** algorithm.
- Applied **OpenMP** directives to parallelize recursive steps.
- Used **cache-aware block allocation** to enhance memory performance.

---

## ðŸ“Š Results

- Achieved up to **3x speedup** over naive matrix multiplication for 1024x1024 matrices.
- Benchmarked against standard C++ implementations using high-resolution timers.
